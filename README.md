NOT ANYMORE BLIND (NAB)
       NAB is an openCV Project which provide guidence for blind people. It helps them to walk without the help of a walking stick or a person.
       The camera(webcam) here detects multiple objects infront of it and if the program identifies it as an obstacle it will measure the distance
       between the obstacle and the camera(webcam) and then convert the measured distance from text to speech and gives a voice output,which helps
       the blind people to identify obstacles infront of them easly.
